# Power BI Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard

**Overview**
Developed an end-to-end Power BI dashboard to analyze sales trends and customer performance, enabling stakeholders to quickly track business KPIs and identify growth opportunities.

**Objective**
To create an interactive and easy-to-use dashboard that provides clear visibility into revenue, customer behavior, and performance across time, regions, and product categories.

**What I Did**
Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query
Built a star-schema data model with fact and dimension tables
Created DAX measures for key metrics such as Total Revenue, Orders, Average Order Value, and time-based comparisons
Designed interactive visuals with slicers, drill-through, and tooltips for deeper analysis

**Tech Stack**
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
Power BI Desktop – Primary data visualization and reporting tool used to design interactive dashboards and business-ready visuals.
Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation, including reshaping tables, handling data types, and creating a structured dataset for analysis.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Implemented to create calculated measures and KPIs such as total revenue, order count, average order value, and time-based metrics (MoM, YTD).
Data Modeling – Established relationships between fact and dimension tables using a star schema to enable accurate filtering, slicing, and drill-down analysis.
File Formats – .pbix used for dashboard development and maintenance; exported .pdf / .png used for sharing dashboard previews.

**Outcome / Key Learnings**
Delivered a business-ready dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making and strengthened my understanding of end-to-end BI development, from data preparation to insight presentation.

**Key Questions This Dashboard Answers**

1.What are the overall sales performance trends over time, and are we meeting our revenue targets?
(Tracks total revenue, monthly growth, and year-over-year comparisons.)
2.Which products, regions, and customer segments are driving the most revenue and profitability?
(Identifies top-performing categories and high-value customer groups.)
3.Where are performance gaps occurring, and what factors are influencing declines or growth?
(Analyzes trends by time, geography, and product to uncover actionable insights.)
